# Aspire JavaScript Docker Example

This repo is to acompany my blog post on `Using Aspire with Docker Hosts` (Blog post coming soon). This repo is currently WIP.

This project demonstrates how to use [Aspire](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire) to orchestrate and deploy a multi-service application using Docker. The stack includes:
- A .NET API backend
- A PostgreSQL database
- A Vue.js frontend built with Vite

**No Azure resources are required**, this setup works with any Docker compatible host, such as Digital Ocean, AWS EC2, or your own server.

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to:
- Use Aspire to manage a .NET API, PostgreSQL, and a JavaScript frontend.
- Publish your Aspire project to Docker Compose.
- Deploy your application to a Digital Ocean droplet (or any Docker host).

## Why Aspire for JavaScript and More?

Aspire provides a powerful way to define, compose, and manage cloud-native applications. Although it's built with .NET in mind, Aspire's flexible architecture allows you to include and orchestrate non-.NET services, such as Node.js or other JavaScript-based apps, alongside .NET services and databases like PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed locally.
- [Aspire CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/whats-new/dotnet-aspire-9.2#-aspire-cli-preview) installed.
- A [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account and a provisioned droplet (or any Docker-compatible host).
- Basic familiarity with .NET, JavaScript, and Docker.


## Running Locally with Aspire

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/intrepid-developer/aspire-javascript-docker.git
   cd aspire-javascript-docker
   ```

2. **Publish Aspire project to Docker Compose:**
   ```sh
   aspire run
   ```

3. **Access your Vue.js frontend** at [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) (replace `PORT` with the port your frontend is configured to use).


## Running Locally with Docker Compose

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/intrepid-developer/aspire-javascript-docker.git
   cd aspire-javascript-docker
   ```

2. **Publish Aspire project to Docker Compose:**
   ```sh
   aspire publish -o /infra
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```sh
   cd infra
   docker compose up
   ```

4. **Access your Vue.js frontend** at [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) (replace `PORT` with the port your frontend is configured to use).

## Deploying to Digital Ocean (or Any Docker Host)

1. **Build and push Docker images** to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or Digital Ocean Container Registry).

2. **Copy your `docker-compose.yml`** to your target host.

3. **SSH into your host:**
   ```sh
   ssh root@your_droplet_ip
   ```

4. **Pull images and start services:**
   ```sh
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. **Verify your app is running** by visiting your host's public IP in a browser.

## Key Takeaways

- Aspire can orchestrate and deploy multi-language, multi-service applications, not just .NET.
- No Azure resources are requiredâ€”works with any Docker-compatible host.
- Docker Compose makes it easy to run your Aspire-managed apps locally and in the cloud.
